# Exploring Taxi Fare Patterns: Factors Influencing Pricing Dynamics

## Project Overview
This project investigates the various factors affecting taxi fare amounts in New York City, including pickup location, trip distance, time of day, and weekday versus weekend trends. By analyzing these patterns, the study aims to inform better pricing strategies for taxi operators, enhance consumer decision-making, and support urban planning initiatives.

## Research Questions
- How do pickup location and trip distance impact taxi fares in New York City?
- What are the differences in average fare amounts between weekdays and weekends?

## Data
- Dataset: NYC Taxi Data
- Key Variables: Pickup and drop-off locations, trip distance, time of day, fare amount, payment type.
- Data Source: Real-time NYC Taxi Data

## Computational Methods
- **Data Visualization**: Using Plots and Matplotlib to explore trends and correlations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns between fare amounts and influencing factors.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Examining fare variations by time of day and day of the week.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Analyzing the impact of pickup and drop-off locations.
- **Prediction and Machine Learning Models**: Implementing Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Linear Regression for fare prediction.

## Modeling Techniques
- **Gradient Boosting**: Utilized for complex non-linear relationships within data.
- **Random Forest and Linear Regression**: Implemented to compare model effectiveness and predictive accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared (RÂ²)

## Results and Conclusions
- Fare amounts are influenced by pickup location, trip distance, and time of day.
- Higher fares are observed during peak hours and weekends.
- Gradient Boosting showed better prediction accuracy compared to Linear Regression.
- R-squared values indicated that the models effectively explained fare variability.

## Real-World Application
- **For Passengers**: Improved transparency and informed decision-making about travel routes and timings.
- **For Taxi Companies**: Dynamic pricing strategies and revenue optimization.
- **For Urban Planners**: Enhanced transportation planning and congestion management.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of historical event data to understand demand spikes.
- Development of dynamic pricing models for better fare predictions.
- User-friendly dashboards and interactive tools for stakeholders.

## Technologies and Software Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and model implementation.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Linear Regression.
